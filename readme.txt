== Description ==

Re-directs users to specific language landing pages that have been created by you.

Admin can generate pages according to language locals (i.e en, es, de, etc...)
and this plugin will identify any browser loading the main page with a language preference and if a page matching exists will redirect users to that page.

== Installation ==

To install this plugin please use the "install" feature from the WordPress site.

Then create the language pages you would like (for example for a spanish page make sure you use the "es" as the permalink)
Update the main settings if the page is not on the root and you're good to go
